<p>The film is about a person who needs to step out of her comfort zone to achieve something important. Additionally, there is an anxiety condition that wears her with catastrophic mind distortions. Maya can&#39;t help with her anxiety but accepts it, therefore, mind distortions are expected.</p>
<p>The open scene sets up the story for development, it first brings disorientation, with feet floating up, as a reference to a common feeling under a psychopathology crisis, followed by the hope and wellness sensation of a warm light bulb, later, revealed behind them. The next shot <u>introduces the protagonist</u>, it shows her living room with her objects and values as well as her care for mental and body health. The sequence, with the calendar hanging on the fridge door, <u>introduces the story conflict</u>: she will have an important appointment.</p>
<p>This story is told in a format that mixes contemplation moments (out of her mind and real) with fast-paced ones (inside her mind and imaginary). The latter explores visual and sound elements to cause oddity and disorientation. There is a crescendo in tension during the mind distortions scenes that will culminate in the revolving door scene, where Maya feels, desperation, confusion and loneliness. Despite the imaginary nature of these expected distortions, the whole process drains her energy, and by the time the meeting happens, she is already exhausted. The interviewer will not break her focus with kindness, because he represents the environment where she doesn&#39;t feel comfortable, the environment that she needs to (metaphorically or not) suit up to be accepted.</p>
<p>The water glass is symbolically represented in this film. It appears first in the fridge scene where the conflict is set, during the night distortion to revert the clock time flowing direction and full of milk in the breakfast scene. It, unconsciously, introduces the shape of the revolving door that will later make a prison for Maya. The glass is also a metaphor for the barrier faced by women in their working careers, like the glass ceiling analogy, which might be part of Maya&#39;s fears, in case she gets accepted in the interview.</p>
