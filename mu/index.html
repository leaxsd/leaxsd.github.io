      <p>The hours preceding a meeting are full of catastrophic mind distortions taking Maya through an exhaustive mental journey, while she tries to fit into a society that doesn&#39;t suit her.</p>
      <hr />

      <h3 id='synopsis' name="synopsis">Synopsis</h3>
      <p>Two feet floating over a white background, as they move apart, a warm light ceiling lamp is revealed. Maya&#39;s living room has many plants, books, records and artworks. She is practicing yoga standing over her shoulders with her feet pointed up, she completes the sequence and has a glass of chill water, at the fridge door a calendar shows a bold red circle around January 10th. Maya Unsuited. </p>
      <p>In a local cafe, Maya meets a friend under the warm sunlight. She walks across a bridge, carrying a bag of vegetables, and stops for a moment to contemplate the view and the water passing under. Back in her apartment, she enjoys herself throughout the day, waters her plants, listens to records, reads and, at dusk, thoughtfully she drinks a cup of tea by the window. In her bedroom, she tries without much skill to iron a shirt and choose a formal outfit for the next day. </p>
      <p>In the middle of the night, Maya wakes and stares at the ceiling, a ticking sound fills the bedroom. Over the bedside table, through a water glass, a wind-up clock shows the time flowing backward. Confused and standing by the bed, she is trying to figure out why the clock&#39;s hand doesn&#39;t move despite the ticking sound. Maya can&#39;t sleep, the clock won&#39;t chime and she will miss her appointment. In the morning, a warm light from a digital clock shines on her face and wakes her. Maya washes her face and feels unexpectedly well-rested. </p>
      <p>Maya is calmly having her breakfast and suddenly a loud fire alarm starts to blare and a little fog starts to rise behind her, she doesn&#39;t notice anything while still lost in her thoughts. When, by chance, she looks aside and sees a pan smoking over the cooktop, she jumps off the table hitting the milk bottle spilling it all over the floor. Back for her catastrophic day-dream, she drinks a sip of milk and looks out the window. It is time to get dressed but what she dresses makes her feel uncomfortable, in vain, she searches for alternatives into the wardrobe. Maya gets lost in unimportant things for a while and when she realizes that is late, she finishes dressing in a hurry. Halfway to leave, she decides to climb the stairs back to wear an amulet necklace, she checks if the windows are closed.</p>
      <p>Maya leaves the house and slams the door on her back, immediately she freezes and stops breathing for a second, &quot;Did I have the keys?&quot;. In the living room, she is searching everywhere for the keys, when accidentally hits a plant holder, which breaks and spreads soil all over the floor. Back to the doorstep, she finds the keys in her bag and walks away. At the bus stop, the next bus will take 15 minutes, she sits and stares at the space. The sound around starts to get fuzzy, with people talking and cars passing by, abruptly the sounds get back to normal, and the bus is already stopped.</p>
      <p>She drops off the bus and a few steps later drops an earbud to the sidewalk. Maya walks at a determined pace, unquietly checking all stimuli around without stopping. More than once, she reaches for her bag seeking something that would stop her. The meeting building looks like an intimidating and terrifying giant. Boldly, she walks through the revolving door which immediately blocks her. Maya is panting. She is now locked inside the revolving door, the time has passed, and she screams out her lungs for help but no one notices. Tired and confused she sits on the floor. In a rage, she hits the door with her bag and bare hands. Desperate, Maya presses her face against the glass while silver confetti revolves inside her cage. Outside her mind, Maya breathes deeply, gently pushes the door, and walks through.</p>
      <p>Maya is waiting, staring into space out of a window when a man in his 50s opens an office door close by. Politely smiling, he offers her coffee or tea. After a second, Maya looks side to him, focused, she doesn&#39;t smile back. </p>
      <p>The end</p>
      <hr />

      <h3 id='directors-vision'>Director&#39;s Vision</h3>
      <p>The film is about a person who needs to step out of her comfort zone to achieve something important. Additionally, there is an anxiety condition that wears her with catastrophic mind distortions. Maya can&#39;t help with her anxiety but accepts it, therefore, mind distortions are expected.</p>
      <p>The open scene sets up the story for development, it first brings disorientation, with feet floating up, as a reference to a common feeling under a psychopathology crisis, followed by the hope and wellness sensation of a warm light bulb, later, revealed behind them. The next shot <u>introduces the protagonist</u>, it shows her living room with her objects and values as well as her care for mental and body health. The sequence, with the calendar hanging on the fridge door, <u>introduces the story conflict</u>: she will have an important appointment.</p>
      <p>This story is told in a format that mixes contemplation moments (out of her mind and real) with fast-paced ones (inside her mind and imaginary). The latter explores visual and sound elements to cause oddity and disorientation. There is a crescendo in tension during the mind distortions scenes that will culminate in the revolving door scene, where Maya feels, desperation, confusion and loneliness. Despite the imaginary nature of these expected distortions, the whole process drains her energy, and by the time the meeting happens, she is already exhausted. The interviewer will not break her focus with kindness, because he represents the environment where she doesn&#39;t feel comfortable, the environment that she needs to (metaphorically or not) suit up to be accepted.</p>
      <p>The water glass is symbolically represented in this film. It appears first in the fridge scene where the conflict is set, during the night distortion to revert the clock time flowing direction and full of milk in the breakfast scene. It, unconsciously, introduces the shape of the revolving door that will later make a prison for Maya. The glass is also a metaphor for the barrier faced by women in their working careers, like the glass ceiling analogy, which might be part of Maya&#39;s fears, in case she gets accepted in the interview.</p>
